# Teeto

Teeto is a discord bot that uses the Riot API in order to gather information about players, champions, matches, and more.
Teeto also utilizes the newly added discord UI elements such as buttons and select menus in order to provide a better user experience. 
Currently, Teeto is far from complete, and due to the discontinuation of the discord.py library, it is unlikely that it will be finished.
